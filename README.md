Java-UDP-WAN-Simulator
======================

Java utility for simulating simple network characteristics found in WANs (delay, jitter, package loss).
This is a convenience class for debugging UDP communication. The DatagramWanEmulator sits between
two specified DatagramSockets and introduces latency, jitter and package loss 
between these two sockets.
